## Getting Started
Instructions for both static/React and Elementor/WordPress implementations will be provided in this repository.

## Running and Following Along with Updates

To watch and follow along with updates to your React landing page in real time:

1. **Open a Terminal**
   Navigate to your project directory:
   ```sh
   cd /Users/zacegleston/Bungleston/Bungleston\ Site/white-squirrel-creative-landing-page
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   If you haven't already, install the required packages:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**
   This will open your app in the browser and automatically reload it when files change:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

4. **View in Browser**
   Your default browser should open to `http://localhost:3000`. If not, open it manually and go to that address.

5. **Watch for Updates**
   As code changes are made and accepted, your running development server will automatically reload and show the latest updates.

6. **(Optional) Use Version Control**
   To track changes over time, you can initialize a git repository:
   ```sh
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

If you ever want to know why a change was made or how something works, just ask!
